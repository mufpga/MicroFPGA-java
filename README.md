# MicroFPGA Java library

[MicroFPGA](https://mufpga.github.io) is an FPGA-based platform for the electronic control of microscopes. It aims at using affordable FPGA to generate or read signals from a variety of devices, including cameras, lasers, servomotors, filter-wheels, etc. It can be controlled via [Micro-Manager](https://micro-manager.org/), or its Java, [Python](https://github.com/mufpga/MicroFPGA-py) and [LabView](https://github.com/mufpga/MicroFPGA-labview) communication libraries, and comes with optional complementary [electronics](https://github.com/mufpga/MicroFPGA-electronics).

## Content

This repository contains the Java communication library. Examples on how to use the library can be found in the [test package](https://github.com/mufpga/MicroFPGA-java/tree/main/src/main/test/de/embl/rieslab/microfpga/examples). This maven project can easily be imported into IntelliJ or Eclipse.
